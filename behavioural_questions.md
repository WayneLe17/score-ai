# Behavioural Questions

### What attracted you to our startup?

I’m excited by the opportunity to help build core AI systems and infrastructure from scratch. This role aligns perfectly with my experience across backend, AI/ML, DevOps, and even frontend work when enhanced by AI tooling. I enjoy taking full ownership and solving problems end-to-end. During the take-home challenge, I shipped a complete MVP in just 1.5 days — showing I can execute fast and deliver value. I’m drawn to fast-paced, early-stage environments where I can contribute meaningfully and grow alongside a team building something truly impactful.

### Where do you see yourself 5 years from now? 

In five years, I want to become an indie hacker — building and launching products on my own. This goal drives my focus on roles that build both deep technical skills and product thinking. Working in a startup gives me exposure to the full product lifecycle, which is invaluable for learning how to create and scale solutions that users love.

### Why did you leave your previous jobs (if applicable)? 

My current role has shifted toward maintaining operations, with fewer AI-focused or innovative projects. While stability is important, I thrive in fast-moving environments where I can build new things and solve tough challenges. I’m looking for a position that allows me to apply my skills to create real value, work on meaningful technology, and continuously learn. That’s why this role stood out — it’s exactly the kind of challenge I’m excited to take on.

### How do you think education can be improved with technology and why? 

Technology can make education more personalized, accessible, and engaging. AI can adapt learning paths to fit each student’s pace and needs, helping them overcome challenges in real-time. Instead of generic lessons, students get targeted support, freeing teachers to focus on mentorship. Tech also gives global access to high-quality content — breaking location and economic barriers. In my view, “Grow & Learn” should be universal, and technology is the key to scaling that mindset across the world, especially in underserved areas.

### If your friends or former employer were asked to comment on 3 good traits and 3 bad traits about you, what would they say and why?

Strengths:

Quick Learner – I pick up new tools and concepts fast, especially in AI.

Ownership – I take responsibility seriously and follow tasks through.

Versatile – My broad skill set helps me solve a wide range of technical problems.

Areas for Improvement:

Technical Jargon – I sometimes overcomplicate explanations for non-technical folks.

Communication Under Stress – I can become less clear when under pressure.

Over-engineering – I’ve learned to focus more on iteration over perfection.

### If you could buy a billboard anywhere around the world, what would it say and where would it be?

If I could buy a billboard anywhere, I would place it in a bustling, fast-paced city. The billboard would be very simple, with just two words in black text on a white background: 'Grow & Learn.'

To me, it’s a mindset — a reminder to keep improving, stay grounded, and treat every challenge as an opportunity. It reflects how I approach both work and life: focus on progress, stay humble, and learn from everything. In a startup, where speed and uncertainty are the norm, this mentality helps me navigate change while holding onto core values.

### What do you believe is true, but can’t prove? 

I believe that I have the potential to one day surpass my mentor. This isn't something I can prove with data or logic right now; it's a deep-seated belief that fuels my drive to constantly learn and push my own boundaries.

My mentor set a very high bar for technical excellence and problem-solving, and has been a huge influence in my career. The belief that I can eventually reach and even exceed that bar is what motivates me to take on harder challenges, dive into unfamiliar territories, and never settle for 'good enough'. It's a personal goal that keeps me hungry and humble, knowing how much I still have to learn. While it remains unproven, this belief shapes my actions and aspirations every day.
